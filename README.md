# Spam-Mail-Detection-using-ML
This project aims at detection of spam mails using machine learning. Open-source Spambase dataset from the UCI machine learning repository has been used which can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase/ <br>
The dataset contains 5569 emails, of which 745 are spam. Spam email is mapped to 1 and legitimate mail is mapped to 0.
Three machine learning models have been used for classification of emails into legitimate and spam, that are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multinomial Naive Bayes and Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM). <br>
A comparison has been made on the results of the above three models based on performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score.
